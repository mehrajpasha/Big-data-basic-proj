Text classification using Big Data
The aim of this notebook is to practise basic text processing using the Apache Spark with the use of the toxic comment text classification dataset. The machine learning and text processing used here are at a poor standard. The goal was mainly to convert the column comment_text into a column of sparse vectors for use in a classification algorithm in the spark ml library.

The pyspark.ml library is used for machine learning with Spark DataFrames. For machine learning with Spark RDDs use the pyspark.mllib library.
